# Blender Scene To SVG 2.0
This Blender Add-on can be used for **exporting MESH/CURVE/GPENCIL/FONT objects in a Blender scene to an SVG file**. Individual shapes can also be **styled and CSS animated** via Blender material settings.
Made and tested for **Blender 3.2+**, however it should also work on older versions as well.

The Add-on comes in two versions:  
1) **scene_to_svg.py** - Recommended, contains 99 % of features, easy and quick to install
2) scene_to_svg_extra_cutting.py - Contains two additional methods for cutting conflicting polygons, requires Python library Shapely and is harder to install. Use only if you really want this experimental feature (and check the User Guide for explanation of how to install it)
